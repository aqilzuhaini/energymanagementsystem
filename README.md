# Arduino Project: LED and Buzzer Control with Temperature Monitoring

This project demonstrates an Arduino setup for controlling LEDs, a buzzer, and a light bulb using buttons, while also monitoring the temperature and playing a melody if the temperature exceeds a defined maximum.
The LEDs represent the switch in electric motor between using battery power or relay, it is based on user's decision. 
The light bulb represent the high-load device such as the diesel engine. 
The temperature represents the oil engine temperature.
