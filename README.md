# Arduino Project: Energy Management System For Retrofit Diesel-Electric Hybrid Ship

The energy management system project aims to develop an innovative solution to optimize the performance and efficiency of a hybrid propulsion system for marine vessels. This system will integrate both an electric motor and a diesel engine, utilizing the Volvo Penta D4 marine engine diesel and the Curtis Instruments motor controller. The goal is to achieve seamless and efficient control of the vessel's propulsion, enhancing fuel efficiency, reducing emissions, and providing precise manoeuvrability. The project will apply concepts of C++ programming and system interfacing on an Arduino platform, using Tinkercad for prototyping and simulation.

This project demonstrates an Arduino setup for controlling LEDs, a buzzer, and a light bulb using buttons, while also monitoring the temperature and playing a melody if the temperature exceeds a defined maximum.
The LEDs represent the switch in electric motor between using battery power or relay, it is based on user's decision. 
The light bulb represent the high-load device such as the diesel engine. 
The temperature represents the oil engine temperature.
